# Anomaly-Transaction-Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting anomalies in transaction data using various algorithms and techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to identify fraudulent or unusual transactions that deviate from normal behavior. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Link

You can access the project and visualizations in the Jupyter notebook in this repository.

## Project Features

The project includes the following components:

- Data Exploration and Visualization: Initial exploration and visualization of the transaction data.
- Feature Engineering: Creation of new features to improve model performance.
- Model Training: Training multiple models, including Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
- Results and Discussion: Summarizing the performance of the models and discussing the findings.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from transaction_anomalies_dataset.csv. It includes transaction records with various features such as transaction amount, age of the account holder, and account type.
